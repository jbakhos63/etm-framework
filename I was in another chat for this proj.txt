I was in another chat for this project, and we ran out of memory.  So I would like to upload some files to see if we can figure out how to proceed where I left off.  For now, just read the files and try to understand what I was working on.  In some future prompt in this chat, I will then let you know what I want done with all this information.  Please note that the ontology_summary.md file is very much out of date.  I uploaded it to show you the format, rigor, and style I will want in an updated version. The etm_framework.py file, and the results files are much more recent, but are still somewhat out of date.  After making them, the python script was getting too bulky, so I broke it up into modules so that we can work on them a little at a time. In the "my operating system" you will see an explanation of the repository structure, my computing system and limitations, some other important comments, and my last results after testing out the modular system.
