# Trial 042 – Phase 3 – Extended Electron Absorption Energy

This trial repeats **Trial 008** on a larger lattice. The goal is to verify that the electron's energy gain from absorbing a hydrogen photon remains the same when boundary effects are negligible.

## Plan
- **Engine**: `ConfigurationFactory.validated_foundation_config("electron_absorption_energy_3")`
- **Lattice**: `51×51×51`
- **Setup**: A ground-state electron is placed at the lattice center with `delta_theta=0.1`. A hydrogen photon timing pattern is prepared. No velocity is used after initialization.
- **Output**: Initial energy, final energy, and energy difference are written to `electron_absorption_energy_3_results.json`.

Run in the background on Windows with:
```cmd
start /B /LOW python run_trial.py
```
The program completes almost instantly and prints a JSON summary.

## Results
A sample run produced:
```json
{
  "initial_energy": -34.001,
  "final_energy": -20.401,
  "energy_change": 13.6,
  "photon_energy": 13.6
}
```
### Latest Results (2025 Run)
See `electron_absorption_energy_3_results.json` for the output.

### Interpretation
The absorbed energy exactly matches the photon energy on a much larger lattice, confirming that ETM's energy transfer rule is independent of boundary size. This consistency improves confidence that the ETM analogue of the Planck constant can be derived from photon absorption data.
