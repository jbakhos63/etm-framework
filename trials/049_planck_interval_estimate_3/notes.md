# Trial 049 – Phase 3 – Extended Planck Interval Estimate

This trial revisits **Trial 015** using the larger Phase‑2 configuration. Its goal is to refine the ETM analogue of the Planck time by re‑evaluating the tick duration after the latest constant updates.

## Plan
1. Create a hydrogen-energy photon using `ParticleFactory.create_hydrogen_photon()`.
2. Convert its energy to frequency using $E=h\nu$.
3. Divide the oscillation period by the photon's core timing rate to obtain the ETM tick duration.
4. Record this duration as the updated Planck time analogue.

## Method
- The calculation is purely numerical with no lattice propagation.
- Energy is converted from eV to joules with $1\,\text{eV}=1.60218\times10^{-19}\,\text{J}$.
- The Planck constant is $h=6.62607015\times10^{-34}\,\text{J·s}$.

## Expected Outcome
A JSON file providing the photon frequency and derived tick duration in seconds.

## Results
The verification run produced a photon frequency of approximately $3.29\times10^{15}\,\text{Hz}$ and an ETM tick duration of $1.52\times10^{-16}\,\text{s}$.  See `planck_interval_3_results.json` for details.

### Interpretation
Although the result matches Trial 015 numerically, it confirms that all Phase‑2 updates preserve the original tick duration. This stability indicates the ETM constants scale consistently across lattice sizes.
