# Trial 016 – Planck Length Baseline

This trial extends **Stage 6 – Planck Scale Analogues** of the *ETM Simulation Research Plan*. Building on Trial 015, which computed the ETM tick duration from a hydrogen photon frequency, we derive the spatial analogue of the Planck length.

## Plan
1. Recreate the hydrogen-energy photon from previous trials.
2. Compute its frequency using $E=h\nu$ to reconfirm the tick duration.
3. Multiply the tick duration by the speed of light in SI units to obtain the ETM lattice step length in meters.
4. Record this value as a preliminary Planck-length analogue.

## Method
- The photon frequency and tick duration are calculated numerically without lattice propagation.
- We assume the photon travels one lattice step per tick, as established in Trial 004.
- Converting the tick duration to meters via the SI speed of light provides the smallest spatial increment represented by a single node step.

## Expected Outcome
A JSON file containing the photon frequency, tick duration in seconds, and the derived lattice step length in meters.

## Results

The script computed these baseline values:
- Photon frequency: ~3.29×10^15 Hz
- Tick duration: 1.52×10^−16 s
- Lattice step length: 4.56×10^−8 m

These values establish the first estimate of the ETM Planck length analogue.
