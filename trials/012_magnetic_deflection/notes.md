# Trial 012 – Magnetic Deflection Between Moving Electrons

This trial continues **Stage 4 – Magnetic Interaction** of the *ETM Simulation Research Plan*. We examine how the echo field of a moving electron deflects a nearby electron that begins at rest.

## Plan
- **Objective**: Demonstrate that a moving electron generates a lateral timing disturbance strong enough to alter the path of a neighbouring electron.
- **Setup**: A `(21,21,21)` lattice with neutral recruiters everywhere. Electron A starts near the left boundary with velocity `(1,0,0)` applied only on the first tick so it begins moving along the $x$‑axis. Electron B is placed two lattice units above its path with no preset velocity. All motion after initialization arises solely from echo gradients.
- **Method**:
  1. Reinforce the echo field at both electron positions each tick.
  2. Advance the ETM engine. Electron A is displaced once by its initial velocity while Electron B moves toward the neighbour with the largest echo from Electron A.
  3. Record both trajectories in `magnetic_deflection_results.json`.

## Results
The run script produced the following paths:
```json
{
  "electron_a": [[1,10,10],[2,10,10],[3,10,10],[4,10,10],[5,10,10],[6,10,10],[7,10,10],[8,10,10],[9,10,10],[10,10,10],[11,10,10]],
  "electron_b": [[1,12,10],[0,12,10],[1,12,10],[0,12,10],[1,12,10],[0,12,10],[1,12,10],[0,12,10],[1,12,10],[0,12,10],[1,12,10]]
}
```
Electron A moved steadily along the $x$‑axis as initialized. Electron B oscillated between neighbouring nodes near the lattice boundary, drawn repeatedly toward the stronger echo field generated by Electron A. This behaviour, produced without assigning Electron B a velocity, demonstrates that moving charges create timing gradients which steer other particles purely via ETM logic.
