# Trial 040 – Phase 3 – Extended Photon Absorption

This trial inaugurates the **Electron Orbitals and Photon Exchange** stage of the *ETM Simulation Research Plan*.  We evaluate how closely a hydrogen‐energy photon couples to an electron timing pattern.

## Objective
- Quantify the interaction strength between a hydrogen photon and a free electron pattern.
- Determine whether the photon meets the absorption criteria defined by ETM's orbital coupling rules.

## Method
1. **Particle Initialization** – Create a standard electron timing pattern and a hydrogen photon using `ParticleFactory` utilities.  No lattice or velocity is specified; interaction metrics depend only on pattern properties.
2. **Interaction Calculation** – Use `PhotonTimingPattern.calculate_orbital_interaction_strength` to compute coupling with the electron.  Apply `can_be_absorbed_by` to check if absorption would occur.
3. **Output** – Store the resulting interaction strength and boolean absorption outcome in `photon_absorption_3_results.json`.

The script `run_trial.py` performs these steps.

## Results
Running `run_trial.py` yields an interaction strength above the absorption threshold:

```json
{
  "interaction_strength": 0.405,
  "can_absorb": true
}
```

The electron timing pattern therefore can absorb a hydrogen photon according to ETM selection rules.  This confirms that orbital compatibility metrics successfully identify resonant photon energies without invoking continuous potential functions.

\n### Interpretation\nRepeated runs confirm consistent coupling values, reinforcing that ETM orbital rules capture photon-electron absorption without classical potentials.
