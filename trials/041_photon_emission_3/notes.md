# Trial 041 – Phase 3 – Extended Photon Emission

This trial repeats **Trial 007** on a larger lattice to confirm that the orbital
coupling rules allow a hydrogen-energy photon to be emitted by an electron
without invoking external potentials. The test mirrors the phase‑1 emission
check but uses the extended configuration intended for long runs on a home
computer.

## Plan
- **Engine**: `ConfigurationFactory.validated_foundation_config("photon_emission_3")`
- **Lattice**: No lattice is required because emission eligibility depends only
  on timing patterns.
- **Setup**: Create a standard electron timing pattern and a hydrogen photon
  using `ParticleFactory`. No velocity is applied after initialization.
- **Output**: Interaction strength and emission boolean are written to
  `photon_emission_3_results.json`.

Run in the background on Windows with:
```cmd
start /B /LOW python run_trial.py
```
The program finishes almost instantly and prints a JSON summary.

## Results
An example run produced:
```json
{
  "interaction_strength": 0.405,
  "can_emit": true
}
```
### Latest Results (2025 Run)
See `photon_emission_3_results.json` for the current output.

### Interpretation
The interaction strength once again exceeds the 0.2 threshold, matching the
absorption test from Trial 023. This symmetry between emission and absorption
reinforces that ETM orbital rules consistently identify compatible photon
energies, improving confidence in the model's accuracy.
