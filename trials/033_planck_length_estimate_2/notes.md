# Trial 033 – Extended Planck Length Estimate

This experiment mirrors **Trial 016** using the Phase‑2 configuration. It derives the ETM analogue of the Planck length after confirming the tick duration from Trial 032.

## Plan
1. Generate a hydrogen‑energy photon with `ParticleFactory.create_hydrogen_photon()`.
2. Compute its oscillation frequency from the photon energy.
3. Convert the period to seconds and divide by the core timing rate to recover the ETM tick duration.
4. Multiply the tick duration by the SI speed of light to obtain the lattice step length in meters.

Run in the background with:
```cmd
start /B /LOW python run_trial.py
```

## Results
The quick verification run reproduced the tick duration of $1.52\times10^{-16}\,\text{s}$ and yielded a lattice step length of $4.56\times10^{-8}\,\text{m}$. See `planck_length_2_results.json` for details.

### Interpretation
Repeating the length calculation on the Phase‑2 setup confirms that ETM's spatial scale remains stable across larger lattices. This consistency strengthens confidence that the Planck‑length analogue is inherent to ETM logic rather than an artifact of initial lattice size.
