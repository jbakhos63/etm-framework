# Trial 011 – Moving Electron Echo Profile

This trial initiates **Stage 4 – Magnetic Interaction** of the *ETM Simulation Research Plan*. It investigates the timing disturbances generated by a single moving electron.

## Plan
- **Objective**: Record echo-field values around a moving electron to quantify the magnetic-like pattern of a travelling charge.
- **Setup**: A `(21,21,21)` lattice with neutral recruiters at every node. An electron begins near the left boundary with velocity `(1,0,0)` applied only at the first tick to offset its starting position. All reinforcement and motion after initialization follow ETM rules.
- **Method**:
  1. At each tick reinforce the echo field at the electron position and call `advance_tick` to update phases and move the particle.
  2. Record echo strengths one lattice step above and below the electron in the $y$ direction.
  3. Store the electron trajectory and sampled echo values in `magnetic_field_results.json`.

The goal is to reveal the characteristic swirl of echoes trailing the moving charge, which will inform later simulations of magnetic forces between multiple moving charges.

## Results
Results appear below after running `run_trial.py`.

### Echo Profile Summary
The recorded `magnetic_field_results.json` shows a gradually increasing echo intensity both above and below the moving electron as it propagates across the lattice. The symmetry indicates that motion along $x$ generates a lateral timing disturbance consistent with the onset of a magnetic-like field. Quantitative evaluation of this disturbance will guide future two-particle experiments aimed at deriving an ETM analogue of vacuum permeability.
