PHASE 2 RESEARCH PRIORITIES - REVISED APPROACH:
Critical Recognition: Current approach uses recruiters as placeholders rather than
fundamental particle timing patterns. For theoretical rigor and cosmological
compatibility, particle foundation must be established first.
Fundamental Question: Do we have sufficient grasp of ETM particle stability to
model atomic structure, or must we first establish particle timing patterns
from first principles?
Cosmological Requirements (from Euclidean Cosmology framework):

Protons must maintain identity stability when ejected from AGN cores
Element recycling requires particle survival across extreme conditions
Other particles may depend on proton stability for their own stability
Particle models must support cosmic-scale element transformation cycles
