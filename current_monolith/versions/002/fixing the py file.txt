ETM particle models must be compatible with cosmological requirements where protons maintain identity stability under extreme conditions (like being ejected near Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which serve as a region of elemental recycling in my cosmology to be explained later) and may serve as stabilizing foundations for other particles.

Key Issues to Address in Rewrite:
1. Framework Structure:

Keep all validated Model B functionality
Maintain hydrogen orbital architecture success
Add particle modeling foundation layer

2. Specific Fixes Needed:

Fix the KeyError: 'allowed' issue in analysis code
Enhance energy calculation framework
Add particle stability validation methods

3. New Particle Foundation Integration:

Add ParticleStabilityTester class
Add ProtonTimingPattern and ElectronTimingPattern classes
Maintain backward compatibility with current trials


Request: "Update etm_framework.py for particle foundation approach while maintaining all current functionality"
Specify: Keep Phase 2 hydrogen success, add Phase 2A particle modeling capabilities
Preserve: All validated Model B mechanisms and compact output

NOTE:  As an aid for fixing any inconsistencies or errors in the existing etm_framework.py script, here is what appeared in my command line when last I ran this script:  C:\Users\joeba\Documents\GitHub\etm_foundations\logic_notebook\versions\002>python etm_framework.py
