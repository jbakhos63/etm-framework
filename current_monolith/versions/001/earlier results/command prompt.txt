EXECUTING PROPERLY CORRECTED TRIAL 070
Key Fix: Identities positioned at SAME location as recruiter
Expected: Successful coexistence demonstration
Recruiter placed at: (15, 15, 15)
Identity A placed at: (15, 15, 15)
Identity B placed at: (15, 15, 15)
Both identities have ancestry: ABC
Recruiter has ancestry: ABC
Expected coexistence at: (15, 15, 15)
