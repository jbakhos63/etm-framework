# Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM) Ontology and Formal Specification

**Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: Enhanced with Detection-Triggered Conflict Resolution  
**Last Updated**: June 2025  
**Validation Status**: Confirmed through Trials 001-074  

---

## Version History

- **Version 1.0**: Initial formal specification through Trial 069
- **Version 2.0**: Enhanced with detection-triggered conflict resolution, 8-connectivity optimization, and symbolic mutation system based on Trials 070-074

---

## Executive Summary

Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM) is a discrete, deterministic alternative to quantum mechanics that models physical reality as a network of nodes with intrinsic timing rates. Particles are emergent patterns of synchronized timing relationships that propagate through the network via phase-coherent recruitment mechanisms. This version incorporates empirically validated detection-triggered conflict resolution, demonstrating that Pauli-like exclusion emerges from information-bearing interactions rather than fundamental field constraints.

**Key Empirical Findings:**
- **8-connectivity optimization**: 35.6% improvement in echo field propagation over 6-connectivity
- **Detection-triggered resolution**: Identical identities coexist passively until detection events trigger symbolic differentiation
- **Symbolic mutation sufficiency**: Ancestry mutation resolves conflicts without particle deletion
- **Long-term coexistence stability**: Multiple identical identities maintain stable orbital occupation

## Mathematical Foundation

### Core Mathematical Structures

**Definition 1.1 (ETM State Space)**  
The ETM state space is defined as:
```
Ω = (L, T, Φ, A, E)
```
where:
- `L ⊂ ℤ³` is a finite 3D lattice of spatial nodes
- `T = ℕ` represents discrete time ticks  
- `Φ: L × T → [0,1)` assigns modular phase to each node at each tick
- `A: L × T → Σ*` assigns ancestry strings from alphabet Σ
- `E: L × T → ℝ≥0` assigns echo reinforcement values

**Definition 1.2 (Connectivity Function)**  
The optimal connectivity function `N: L → P(L)` is defined for 8-connectivity as:
```
N(x,y,z) = {(x',y',z') ∈ L : |||(x',y',z') - (x,y,z)|||∞ = 1 ∧ |{i: x'ᵢ ≠ xᵢ}| ≤ 2}
```
This provides each node with up to 8 neighbors, optimized for information propagation efficiency.

**Definition 1.3 (Detection Event)**  
A detection event is a 5-tuple:
```
D = (τ, λ, P, I, R)
```
where:
- `τ ∈ T` is the occurrence tick
- `λ ∈ L` is the spatial location  
- `P` is the triggering particle (optional)
- `I ⊆ Identity` is the set of affected identities
- `R ∈ ConflictResolution` is the applied resolution method

---

## Axioms

### A1 — Modular Phase Identity  
**Statement**: Every modular identity possesses a phase state `θ ∈ [0,1)` that advances deterministically by a fixed increment `Δθ` at each discrete time tick.

**Formal Expression**:
```
∀ identity i, ∀ tick t: θᵢ(t+1) = (θᵢ(t) + Δθᵢ) mod 1
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Phase values must be stored as double-precision floating point numbers
- Modular arithmetic must preserve precision to avoid drift
- Phase advancement occurs exactly once per identity per tick

---

### A2 — Discrete Time Evolution  
**Statement**: All state changes occur at integer-valued time steps called ticks. No interpolation or subdivision of time is permitted.

**Formal Expression**:
```
∀ state changes: ∂S/∂t is undefined; S(t) defined only for t ∈ ℕ
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Global tick counter must be monotonically increasing integer
- All state updates must be synchronized to tick boundaries
- No fractional or continuous time representations allowed

---

### A3 — Ancestry-Based Identity Distinction  
**Statement**: Each identity carries an immutable symbolic ancestry tag that determines compatibility for reformation and conflict resolution.

**Formal Expression**:
```
∀ identity i: ∃ ancestry aᵢ ∈ Σ* such that reform_compatible(i,j) depends on similarity(aᵢ, aⱼ)
```

**Enhancement for Detection Resolution**:
Ancestry may be modified through detection-triggered symbolic mutation:
```
D = detection_event(τ, λ, P, {i,j}, SYMBOLIC_MUTATION) 
⟹ ∃ k: aᵢ' = aᵢ ⊕ mutation_tag(k)
```

---

### A4 — Echo-Based Return Eligibility  
**Statement**: Identity reformation requires sufficient echo reinforcement, computed as a hybrid of local and neighborhood echo values.

**Formal Expression**:
```
ρ_hybrid(λ,t) = ω_local · ρ_local(λ,t) + ω_neigh · ρ_neigh(λ,t)
return_eligible(i,λ,t) ⟹ ρ_hybrid(λ,t) ≥ ρ_min
```

**Parameters** (validated through connectivity optimization):
- `ω_local = 0.6, ω_neigh = 0.4` (hybrid weighting)
- `ρ_min = 25.0` (global threshold)
- Neighborhood calculated over 8-connected topology

---

### A5 — Phase-Coherent Return Constraints  
**Statement**: Return requires simultaneous satisfaction of phase alignment, ancestry compatibility, and echo sufficiency.

**Formal Expression**:
```
return_allowed(i,λ,t) ⟺ 
    phase_match(θᵢ(t), θ_recruiter(λ,t)) ∧
    ancestry_match(aᵢ, a_recruiter(λ)) ∧  
    echo_match(ρ_hybrid(λ,t))
```

**Detection Enhancement**:
```
∀ D = detection_event: |affected_identities(D)| > 1 
⟹ apply_conflict_resolution(D) before next return evaluation
```

---

### A6 — Temporal Coherence Requirements  
**Statement**: Return eligibility must persist across a coherence window of consecutive ticks to ensure stable reformation.

**Formal Expression**:
```
coherent_return(i,λ,t,N) ⟺ ∀k ∈ [0,N): return_allowed(i,λ,t+k)
```

**Default Parameters**:
- Coherence window `N = 1` for basic trials
- Extended coherence `N ≥ 5` for orbital stability analysis

---

### A7 — Detection-Triggered Conflict Resolution *(New)*  
**Statement**: Multiple identities may coexist at the same spatial location until a detection event triggers conflict resolution through symbolic differentiation.

**Formal Expression**:
```
passive_coexistence(I,λ,t) ⟺ 
    (∀i,j ∈ I: position(i) = position(j) = λ) ∧ 
    (¬∃ D: detection_event(t,λ,_,I,_))

active_resolution(I,λ,t) ⟺
    ∃ D: detection_event(t,λ,_,I,R) ⟹ apply_resolution(I,R)
```

**Resolution Methods**:
- `SYMBOLIC_MUTATION`: Modify ancestry tags for distinction
- `IDENTITY_RENAME`: Append suffixes to identity tags  
- `PHASE_SEPARATION`: Apply small phase offsets
- `COEXISTENCE`: Allow permanent overlap (passive mode)

---

## Rules

### R1 — Return Eligibility Evaluation  
**Statement**: Return is permitted if and only if phase, ancestry, and echo conditions are simultaneously satisfied, with coexistence allowed until detection.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def evaluate_return_eligibility(identity, position, tick):
    recruiter = get_recruiter(position)
    if not recruiter:
        return False, "no_recruiter"
    
    # Core gating conditions
    phase_match = abs(identity.theta - recruiter.theta) <= PHASE_TOLERANCE
    ancestry_match = evaluate_ancestry_compatibility(identity.ancestry, recruiter.ancestry, tick)
    echo_match = calculate_hybrid_echo(position) >= RHO_MIN
    
    # Coexistence evaluation
    coexisting_identities = get_coexisting_identities(position)
    detection_required = check_detection_required(position, identity, coexisting_identities)
    
    if phase_match and ancestry_match and echo_match:
        if not detection_required:
            return True, "coexistence_allowed"
        else:
            trigger_detection_event(position, identity, coexisting_identities)
            return evaluate_post_detection(identity, position)
    
    return False, "gating_failed"
```

---

### R2 — Phase Advancement Rule  
**Statement**: All identities advance their phase by their characteristic `Δθ` value at each tick.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def advance_phase(identity):
    identity.theta = (identity.theta + identity.delta_theta) % 1.0
    identity.tick_memory += 1
    if identity.particle_module:
        identity.particle_module.update_master_phase()
```

---

### R3 — Identity Reformation with Coexistence Support *(Enhanced)*  
**Statement**: Successful return locks identity to recruiter rhythm and registers coexistence relationships.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def execute_reformation(identity, recruiter, position):
    # Lock to recruiter rhythm
    identity.theta = recruiter.theta_recruiter
    identity.ancestry = recruiter.ancestry_recruiter
    
    # Register coexistence
    coexisting = get_coexisting_identities(position)
    if len(coexisting) > 0:
        identity.return_status = COEXISTING
        register_coexistence(position, identity)
    else:
        identity.return_status = COMPLETE
    
    # Boost echo field
    boost_echo_field(position, REINFORCEMENT_AMOUNT)
    recruiter.add_returned_identity(identity)
```

---

### R4 — Echo Decay Rule  
**Statement**: Echo fields decay multiplicatively at each tick unless reinforced.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def apply_echo_decay(lattice, decay_factor=0.95):
    for position in lattice:
        lattice[position].rho_local *= decay_factor
```

---

### R5 — Echo Inheritance with 8-Connectivity *(Optimized)*  
**Statement**: Nodes inherit echo reinforcement from neighbors using optimal 8-connectivity topology.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def apply_echo_inheritance(lattice, alpha=0.10):
    new_values = {}
    for position in lattice:
        neighbors = get_8_connected_neighbors(position)
        if neighbors:
            neighbor_echo = sum(lattice[n].rho_local for n in neighbors) / len(neighbors)
            new_values[position] = lattice[position].rho_local + alpha * neighbor_echo
    
    # Apply all updates simultaneously
    for position, new_value in new_values.items():
        lattice[position].rho_local = new_value
```

**Connectivity Definition**:
```python
def get_8_connected_neighbors(x, y, z):
    # 6-connectivity (faces)
    neighbors = [(x±1,y,z), (x,y±1,z), (x,y,z±1)]
    # +2 edge connectivity (xy-plane edges) - optimal addition
    neighbors.extend([(x±1,y±1,z)])
    return filter_bounds(neighbors)
```

---

### R6 — Passive Conflict Evaluation *(Modified)*  
**Statement**: In passive mode, identities do not conflict based solely on phase/ancestry overlap. Conflict requires detection.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def check_passive_conflict(identity1, identity2, enable_passive_coexistence=True):
    if enable_passive_coexistence:
        return False  # No passive conflicts allowed
    
    # Legacy behavior (Model A)
    if (identity1.position == identity2.position and 
        identity1.ancestry == identity2.ancestry):
        phase_diff = min_modular_distance(identity1.theta, identity2.theta)
        return phase_diff < EPSILON
    
    return False
```

---

### R7 — Coexistence Registry Management *(New)*  
**Statement**: The system maintains a registry of coexisting identities and their relationships.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def register_coexistence(position, identity):
    if position not in coexistence_registry:
        coexistence_registry[position] = []
    
    if identity.unique_id not in coexistence_registry[position]:
        coexistence_registry[position].append(identity.unique_id)
        
    # Update identity's coexistence tracking
    other_identities = [id for id in coexistence_registry[position] 
                       if id != identity.unique_id]
    identity.coexisting_with = other_identities
    
    if len(other_identities) > 0:
        identity.return_status = COEXISTING
```

---

### R8 — Detection Event Creation *(New)*  
**Statement**: Detection events are created when particles with detection signatures interact or when measurement-like operations occur.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def create_detection_event(event_type, position, triggering_particle=None):
    affected_identities = get_coexisting_identities(position)
    
    event = DetectionEvent(
        event_type=event_type,
        position=position,
        tick=current_tick,
        triggering_particle=triggering_particle,
        affected_identities=affected_identities
    )
    
    detection_events.append(event)
    return event
```

**Detection Triggers**:
- Photon arrival at occupied position
- Particle collision events
- Measurement probe operations
- Energy level transitions

---

### R9 — Symbolic Conflict Resolution *(New)*  
**Statement**: Detection events trigger conflict resolution through symbolic mutation rather than particle deletion.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def resolve_detection_conflict(detection_event):
    if len(detection_event.affected_identities) < 2:
        return {"resolution": "no_conflict"}
    
    resolution_method = get_conflict_resolution_method()
    
    if resolution_method == SYMBOLIC_MUTATION:
        # Apply ancestry mutation to distinguish identities
        for i, identity in enumerate(detection_event.affected_identities[1:], 1):
            mutation_tag = f"_{i}"
            identity.apply_symbolic_mutation("ancestry_append", mutation_tag=mutation_tag)
            
    elif resolution_method == IDENTITY_RENAME:
        # Rename identity tags to differentiate
        for i, identity in enumerate(detection_event.affected_identities[1:], 1):
            mutation_tag = f"*{i}"
            identity.apply_symbolic_mutation("identity_suffix", mutation_tag=mutation_tag)
            
    elif resolution_method == PHASE_SEPARATION:
        # Apply small phase offsets
        for i, identity in enumerate(detection_event.affected_identities[1:], 1):
            phase_offset = i * 0.02
            identity.theta = (identity.theta + phase_offset) % 1.0
    
    # Record resolution application
    for identity in detection_event.affected_identities:
        identity.conflict_resolution_applied = resolution_method
    
    return {"resolution": resolution_method, "mutations_applied": len(detection_event.affected_identities)-1}
```

---

### R10 — Ancestry Gating with Smoothing  
**Statement**: Ancestry compatibility includes smoothing logic for near-matches and mutation tolerance.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def evaluate_ancestry_compatibility(identity_ancestry, recruiter_ancestry, tick):
    if not ANCESTRY_REQUIRED:
        return True
    
    if SMOOTHING_ENABLED and tick >= SMOOTHING_TICK:
        mismatch = count_mismatch_tags(identity_ancestry, recruiter_ancestry)
        effective_mismatch = apply_symbolic_smoothing(mismatch)
        return effective_mismatch <= SMOOTHING_THRESHOLD
    else:
        return identity_ancestry == recruiter_ancestry

def apply_symbolic_smoothing(mismatch):
    # Empirically validated smoothing function
    if mismatch == 4:
        return 2
    elif mismatch == 3:
        return 2
    return mismatch
```

---

### R11 — Connectivity Optimization Rule *(New)*  
**Statement**: Network connectivity is optimized at 8-connections per node for maximum information propagation efficiency.

**Empirical Validation**:
- 35.6% improvement in echo field propagation over 6-connectivity
- Diminishing returns beyond 8-connectivity
- Optimal balance of performance vs complexity

**Implementation**:
```python
OPTIMAL_CONNECTIVITY = 8

def get_optimal_neighbors(position):
    return get_neighbors(position, connectivity=OPTIMAL_CONNECTIVITY)
```

---

### R12 — Identity Mutation History Tracking *(New)*  
**Statement**: All symbolic mutations are recorded with complete history for analysis and reversal.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def apply_symbolic_mutation(identity, mutation_type, new_ancestry=None, mutation_tag=None):
    original_ancestry = identity.ancestry
    
    if mutation_type == "ancestry_append":
        identity.ancestry = identity.ancestry + mutation_tag
    elif mutation_type == "ancestry_replace":
        identity.ancestry = new_ancestry
    elif mutation_type == "identity_suffix":
        identity.module_tag = identity.module_tag + mutation_tag
    
    # Record complete mutation history
    identity.mutation_history.append({
        "tick": current_tick,
        "type": mutation_type,
        "original": original_ancestry,
        "new": identity.ancestry,
        "tag": mutation_tag,
        "detection_event_id": current_detection_event.id if current_detection_event else None
    })
    
    identity.is_mutated = True
```
