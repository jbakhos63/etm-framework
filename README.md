# ETM Framework - Euclidean Timing Mechanics

A physics simulation framework implementing Euclidean Timing Mechanics with nucleon internal structure modeling.

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Model B Detection-Triggered Conflict Resolution (Validated)
- ✅ Calibrated Energy Calculations (<1% accuracy vs quantum mechanics)
- ✅ Enhanced Proton Patterns (>95% AGN survival)
- ✅ Nucleon Internal Structure with Beta Decay (n → p + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ)

## Quick Start
```bash
python run_etm.py

Framework Status

Version: 2.3 Nucleon Enhanced
Validation Trials: 070-074
Calibration Status: 129,818x improvement in energy accuracy
Current Phase: Modularization from validated monolithic framework

Research Impact
ETM demonstrates that weak force emerges from pattern reorganization in composite timing structures, providing an information-theoretic foundation for nuclear physics.
