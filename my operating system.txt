Some things to keep in mind:

Different chats will run different tests, potentially involving different modules.  After results are interpreted from a test, there might be adjustments to script; these adjustments might sometimes have to be implemented across the script of many modules or even the script of all modules.  So each chat needs to have access to some sort of summary .md document that is kept updated that rigorously, formally, completely, accurately, and precisely defines current state of the logic of ETM, such that human beings and AI could read this document, and use it to write code that duplicates all work in ETM.  This summary must have the axioms, rules, definitions and particle identities, and logical flow all presented in a way consistent with professional journals on logic, particle physics, and computer programming.  If this document is kept updated properly, then independent chats running different modules and exploring different subsections of physics and ETM, will still be united in focus because of this document.  The logical flow section must explain how the modular system works to simulate particle physics in ETM.  Remember that the script must be set up such that any results (.json files, for example) are summarized in an appropriate way so that needed information is not lost, yet the files are small enough to function properly on my home computing system (details below), small enough to be easily uploaded to online AI, and small enough that specific AI chats can utilize and converse about the files without a problem.  All these statements apply to individual script files as well.

Ready for next step: Extract trials and analysis modules


I strongly suspect that as we explore ETM we are going to be led in entirely new directions that are very different than standard physics.  Let me give you an example:  As I was going through trials, AI was trying to duplicate the Pauli exclusion principle, and it was holding us up.  I suggested that maybe the Puali exclusion principle was emergent and was actually caused by detection apparatus, but that perhaps when electrons are left by themselves they are happy to get along.  Here, ETM was trying to tell us something, and we almost missed it because we were trying to force our results to match existing theory.

So I don't want to assume things like bosons.  I suspect that they don't exist, just like I suspect that dark matter and/or dark energy don't exist.  I say these things tentatively, of course, because ultimately I must as a scientist go where the evidence leads.  So I could be wrong about this --- BUT I do not want to miss potential discoveries because of being locked into standard modeling.  I believe that ETM is much more subtle than this!  To give another example:  I have often thought that quantum interactions were extremely subtle and beautiful like complex music, and I suspected that high-energy particle accelerators might be obfuscating a lot, even as they taught us a lot.  Like let's suppose some aliens wanted to know why I really enjoy corvette automobiles.  So they take the automobile and smash it into a wall at 200 mph, and then try to discern from the wreckage what was attractive about the automobile.  Well, I have made this prompt too long.  My only point is that I do not want the ETM document to be assuming things like quarks and/or bosons prematurely.  I suspect we are going to be redefining a lot of things in very new ways.  I think it would be entirely appropriate to say something like "ETM explores the observational effects now attributed to bosons in another way ..... "  In fact, maybe this is what you were trying to say, and my entire criticism is misplaced?
