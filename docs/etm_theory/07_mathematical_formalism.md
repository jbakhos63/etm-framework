## 7. Mathematical Formalism

Here we outline the discrete mathematics that supports ETM, including lattice update equations and information metrics used to analyze timing patterns.

### 7.1 ETM State Space Mathematics

The state space of Euclidean Timing Mechanics is the set of all possible lattice configurations and timing assignments that satisfy the foundational definitions and axioms established in Chapters&nbsp;1–6.  Each discrete tick of ETM corresponds to a mapping of identities, recruiters, and echo fields over the lattice.

#### Mathematical Framework 7.1: Discrete Lattice State Space

**Statement**:  The global state at tick \(t\) is represented as a finite tuple
\(S(t) = (\mathcal{I}(t),\;\mathcal{R}(t),\;\mathcal{E}(t))\) where
\(\mathcal{I}\) is the set of identities, \(\mathcal{R}\) the recruiter map, and
\(\mathcal{E}\) the echo field map.  Each component obeys the discrete lattice
structure defined in Definitions&nbsp;1.1–1.20.

**Formal Expression**:
```math
\begin{aligned}
S(t) &= \big\{(i_k, \lambda_k, \theta_k, \Delta\theta_k, \alpha_k)\big\}_{k=1}^{N_I(t)} \\
     &\quad \cup \;\big\{(r_j, \lambda_j, \theta^{r}_j, \Delta\theta^{r}_j)\big\}_{j=1}^{N_R(t)} \\
     &\quad \cup \;\big\{(\lambda_m, \rho_m(t))\big\}_{m=1}^{|L|}
\end{aligned}
```
where
- \(i_k\) are identity labels with ancestry \(\alpha_k\) and phase parameters,
- \(r_j\) are recruiters located at lattice sites \(\lambda_j\), and
- \(\rho_m(t)\) is the echo field strength at lattice position \(\lambda_m\).

**State Cardinality**:
```math
|S(t)| = N_I(t) + N_R(t) + |L|
```
with \(|L| = L_x \times L_y \times L_z\) the lattice size.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Data structures must index identities and recruiters by lattice coordinate.
- State updates must occur synchronously at each tick following Rule&nbsp;R2.
- Memory consumption scales linearly with lattice volume and number of identities.

**Physical Interpretation**:  The finite tuple \(S(t)\) encodes all dynamical
information of the ETM universe at tick \(t\).  It replaces the continuous state
vectors of classical field theory with explicit discrete assignments for every
lattice node.

**Validation Status**:  ✅ **Operationally verified** in all trials—finite tuple
representations reproduce previously validated results with deterministic
reproducibility.

#### Mathematical Framework 7.2: Modular Phase Arithmetic

**Statement**:  All phase values in \(S(t)\) evolve according to modular
arithmetic on \([0,1)\).  For each identity or recruiter with phase \(\theta\) and
rate \(\Delta\theta\):
```math
\theta(t+1) = (\theta(t) + \Delta\theta) \bmod 1.
```
This rule is the discrete-time analogue of periodic phase advancement and is
consistent with Definitions&nbsp;1.5–1.7 and Axioms&nbsp;A1–A2.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Use floating point or rational arithmetic with wraparound at 1.0.
- Advance all phases simultaneously to maintain deterministic evolution.

**Physical Interpretation**:  Modular phase arithmetic encodes timing
relationships among identities.  Phase locking, coherence, and synchronization
emerge from integer relationships among \(\Delta\theta\) values.

**Validation Status**:  ✅ **Fundamentally confirmed**—phase updates yield exact
reproduction of energy levels and orbital periods when coupled with calibrated
parameters.

#### Mathematical Framework 7.3: 8-Connected Graph Theory

**Statement**:  The lattice \(L\) forms an 8-connected graph in which each node
has edges to neighbors defined by Definition&nbsp;1.3.  Neighbor sets
\(\mathcal{N}_8(\lambda)\) are used for echo inheritance and
identity movement.

**Formal Expression**:
```math
\mathcal{N}_8(\lambda) = \{\lambda' \in L : \|\lambda' - \lambda\|_{\infty} = 1 \;\land\; |\{i : \lambda'_i \neq \lambda_i\}| \le 2\}.
```
Edges exist only between \(\lambda\) and each element of \(\mathcal{N}_8(\lambda)\).

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Precompute neighbor offset tables for efficiency.
- Apply boundary rules from Definition&nbsp;1.4 for edge and corner nodes.

**Physical Interpretation**:  Treating the lattice as an 8-connected graph
captures the empirically optimal information pathways that underpin ETM energy
propagation and spatial coordination.

**Validation Status**:  ✅ **Empirically optimized**—8-connectivity provides the
best trade‑off between propagation speed and computational cost.

#### Mathematical Framework 7.4: Echo Field Difference Equations

**Statement**:  Echo fields evolve according to discrete difference equations
combining decay, inheritance, and reinforcement terms as introduced in
Definitions&nbsp;1.13–1.15.  For each lattice site \(\lambda\):
```math
\rho(\lambda,t+1) = \beta\,\rho(\lambda,t) + \alpha\,\langle\rho_{\mathcal{N}_8(\lambda)}(t)\rangle + R(\lambda,t).
```
Here \(\beta\) is the decay factor, \(\alpha\) the inheritance rate, and
\(R(\lambda,t)\) the direct reinforcement from successful recruitment or
interaction events.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Update echo fields in two phases: apply decay and inheritance, then add
  reinforcement events.
- Maintain numerical stability for small \(\rho\) values (typically
  \(\beta=0.95\), \(\alpha=0.10\)).

**Physical Interpretation**:  Echo difference equations encode spatial memory and
information diffusion.  They replace classical potential fields with a discrete
information accumulator that influences recruitment eligibility and particle
energy calculations.

**Validation Status**:  ✅ **Parameter‑optimized**—the above equations reproduce
stable lattice behavior and enable accurate calibrated energy computations.
