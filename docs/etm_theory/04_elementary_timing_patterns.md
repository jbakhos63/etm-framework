## 4. Elementary Timing Patterns

Elementary timing patterns specify the fundamental rhythmic structures that serve as building blocks for all higher ETM constructs. Each pattern is characterized by its phase advancement rate, spatial node configuration, stability metrics, and interaction properties. The patterns presented in this chapter have been validated through simulation and serve as canonical references for particle‑level modeling.

### 4.1 Electron‑Type Timing Pattern

#### Definition 4.1: Electron‑Type Timing Pattern

**Statement**: The electron-type pattern is a metastable lepton timing configuration characterized by a uniform phase advancement rate  
\(\Delta \theta_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.05\) (yielding a 20‑tick period). Its node arrangement and stability metrics are optimized for compatibility with proton-type patterns, enabling the formation of atomic orbitals.

**Formal Expression**:
\[
\theta_{\mathrm{e}}(t+1) = \bigl(\theta_{\mathrm{e}}(t) + 0.05\bigr) \bmod 1
\]

**Node Configuration**:

| Relative Position | Timing Rate | Role                |
|------------------:|------------:|-------------------- |
| (0, 0, 0)         | 0.7         | electron_core       |
| (±1, 0, 0)        | 0.5         | orbital_interface   |
| (0, ±1, 0)        | 0.5         | orbital_interface   |
| (±2, 0, 0)        | 0.3         | orbital_cloud       |

This configuration reflects the distributed nature of the electron timing pattern: a coherent core surrounded by an interface shell and a sparse orbital cloud, facilitating interaction with proton fields.

**Stability Metrics** (empirically derived):

- Core coherence: 0.85
- Orbital compatibility: 0.90
- Interaction flexibility: 0.88
- Binding capability: 0.92

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. Initialize the identity with phase \(\theta_{\mathrm{e}} \in [0,1)\) and advancement rate \(\Delta \theta_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.05\).
2. Construct the node list as specified above.  
   In code, this corresponds to `ElectronTimingPattern()` in `etm/particles.py`.
3. Ensure phase advancement occurs once per tick according to the global update protocol (see Rule R1).
4. Validate stability metrics during initialization; reject configurations with metrics below established thresholds.
5. Track phase evolution and node interactions to detect possible transitions or decay events.

**Physical Interpretation**:  
The electron-type timing pattern models the discrete temporal rhythm associated with an electron in ETM. The 20‑tick period and node arrangement provide a spatially extended yet coherent pattern capable of coupling to proton-type recruiters, resulting in atomic orbital formation. The metastable nature of the pattern allows transitions via photon absorption or emission while preserving lepton number.

**Validation Status**: ✅ **Experimentally confirmed** through hydrogen-atom simulations demonstrating stable electron–proton timing coherence for more than 100 ticks with coherence strength exceeding 0.95.

When extending this subsection or refining the stability metrics, it may be helpful to rerun the existing electron orbital simulations (`ETMEngine` with `ElectronTimingPattern`) and share updated statistics such as coherence strength and binding energy. These results can then be incorporated into the documentation to strengthen the empirical foundation of the pattern.

### 4.2 Enhanced Proton‑Type Timing Pattern (AGN‑survivable)

#### Definition 4.2: Enhanced Proton‑Type Timing Pattern (AGN‑survivable)

**Statement**: The enhanced proton-type pattern is a highly stable baryon timing configuration designed to survive extreme astrophysical environments, particularly active galactic nucleus (AGN) ejection scenarios. Its multi-shell node architecture provides redundant timing coordination, yielding an AGN survival probability greater than 0.90.

**Formal Expression**:
\[
\theta_{\mathrm{p}}(t+1) = \bigl(\theta_{\mathrm{p}}(t) + 0.05\bigr) \bmod 1
\]

| (0, 0, ±1)        | 0.95        | primary_stabilizing_shell    |
| (±1, ±1, 0)       | 0.95        | primary_stabilizing_shell    |
| (±1, 0, ±1)       | 0.85        | intermediate_stabilizing_shell |
| (0, ±1, ±1)       | 0.85        | intermediate_stabilizing_shell |
| (±1, ±1, ±1)      | 0.85        | intermediate_stabilizing_shell |
| (±2, 0, 0)        | 0.75        | enhanced_edge_connector      |
| (0, ±2, 0)        | 0.75        | enhanced_edge_connector      |
| (±2, ±1, 0)       | 0.75        | enhanced_edge_connector      |

Its redundant node shells maintain timing coherence under AGN ejection forces, enabling protons to traverse galactic cores without disintegration. The design preserves compatibility with electron orbitals and allows nucleon assembly while resisting high-field disruption.

**Validation Status**: ✅ **Validated** through AGN ejection simulations showing survival probabilities above 90% for durations exceeding 50 ticks.

#### Definition 4.3: Neutrino‑Type Pattern

**Statement**: The neutrino-type pattern is an ultralight lepton timing configuration proposed to mediate long-range synchronization of phase information across spacetime. It advances with the same fundamental rate as other elementary patterns,
\(\Delta \theta_{\nu} = 0.05\), but interacts only weakly with baryonic structures, enabling propagation over large distances with minimal disturbance.

**Formal Expression**:
\[
\theta_{\nu}(t+1) = \bigl(\theta_{\nu}(t) + 0.05\bigr) \bmod 1
\]

**Node Configuration**:

| Relative Position | Timing Rate | Role                  |
|------------------:|------------:|---------------------- |
| (0, 0, 0)         | 0.2         | neutrino_core         |
| (0, 0, ±5)        | 0.2         | propagation_connector |
| (0, 0, ±10)       | 0.1         | phase_signal_node     |

This sparse linear arrangement supports rapid propagation while retaining enough coherence to relay timing information between distant regions.

**Stability Metrics** (simulation estimates):

- Core coherence: 0.70
- Propagation stability: 0.75
- Interaction cross-section: 0.05
- Timing signal fidelity: 0.80

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. Initialize the pattern with phase \(\theta_{\nu} \in [0,1)\) and advancement rate \(\Delta \theta_{\nu} = 0.05\).
2. Construct the node array as above; this corresponds to `NeutrinoTimingPattern()` in `etm/particles.py`.

**Physical Interpretation**:
The neutrino-type pattern provides a theoretical mechanism for maintaining weak phase correlation over astrophysical distances. Its minimal interaction cross-section permits traversal of dense matter with negligible disruption, suggesting a role in coordinating timing information between remote regions of the ETM lattice.

**Validation Status**: ⚠️ **Preliminary** — limited simulations show stable propagation for more than 50 ticks, but empirical confirmation and detailed parameter tuning remain ongoing.

### 4.4 Anti-Pattern Structures (Phase-Conjugated Patterns)

#### Definition 4.4: Anti-Pattern Structures

**Statement**: An anti-pattern is the phase-conjugated counterpart of a timing pattern. Each node advances with the same fundamental rate as the corresponding pattern but with a half-cycle phase offset, yielding destructive interference when directly superimposed. Anti-pattern structures serve as theoretical models for antimatter timing configurations and phase-cancellation phenomena.

**Formal Expression**:
\[
\bar{\theta}(t+1) = \bigl(\bar{\theta}(t) + \Delta\theta\bigr) \bmod 1, \qquad \bar{\theta}(t) = \bigl(\theta(t) + 0.5\bigr) \bmod 1
\]
where \(\theta(t)\) is the phase of the base pattern and \(\Delta\theta\) its advancement rate (typically 0.05).

**Node Configuration**:

| Relative Position | Timing Rate | Role                     |
|------------------:|------------:|------------------------- |
| (0, 0, 0)         | same as base| anti_core                |
| (\*mirror base\*) | same as base| phase_conjugated_nodes   |

Anti-pattern nodes mirror the spatial arrangement of the original pattern. Each node maintains a phase offset of 0.5 relative to its counterpart.

**Stability Metrics** (simulation estimates):

- Phase cancellation efficacy: 0.95
- Mirror coherence: 0.85
- Interaction cross-section with base pattern: 0.90
- Residual timing drift: 0.05

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. Generate the anti-pattern by cloning the base pattern’s node list and shifting all phases by 0.5.
2. Ensure phase advancement is synchronized with the base pattern’s \(\Delta\theta\).
3. During simulation, monitor pair interactions for annihilation events when an anti-pattern overlaps its base pattern.
4. Reject configurations where mirror coherence falls below 0.8 or drift exceeds 0.1 per 50 ticks.
5. Track energy release metrics when anti-patterns annihilate with their counterparts.

**Physical Interpretation**:
Anti-pattern structures model antiparticles or phase-conjugated waveforms within ETM. When superimposed with their corresponding patterns, the half-cycle offset leads to destructive interference, effectively canceling the timing signal and releasing energy into the surrounding lattice.

**Validation Status**: ⚠️ **Preliminary** — initial simulations demonstrate expected phase cancellation, but comprehensive tests of annihilation dynamics are ongoing.

For further refinement, run pair-annihilation simulations (`ParticleFactory.create_antipattern_pair` with `ParticleStabilityTester`) to measure energy release and drift behavior. Incorporate updated statistics to solidify the stability metrics and interaction parameters.

#### Definition 4.5: Photon-Type Traveling Pattern

**Statement**: The photon-type traveling pattern is an electromagnetic timing disturbance that propagates through the ETM lattice at the maximum allowable rate. Each node advances with a uniform phase increment \(\Delta \theta_{\gamma} = 0.05\) and maintains coherent front propagation across all spatial directions.

**Formal Expression**:
\[
\theta_{\gamma}(t+1) = \bigl(\theta_{\gamma}(t) + 0.05\bigr) \bmod 1
\]

**Node Configuration**:

| Relative Position | Timing Rate | Role                |

| (±1, 0, 0)        | 1.2         | propagation_front    |
| (0, ±1, 0)        | 1.2         | propagation_front    |
| (0, 0, ±1)        | 1.2         | propagation_front    |
| (±1, ±1, 0)       | 1.0         | edge_propagation     |
| (±2, 0, 0)        | 0.8         | extended_propagation |
| (0, ±2, 0)        | 0.8         | extended_propagation |

This arrangement models a discrete wavefront moving with 8‑connectivity, ensuring isotropic propagation while preserving energy content.

**Stability Metrics** (simulation estimates):

- Electromagnetic coherence: 0.99
- Propagation efficiency: 0.98
- Space traversal capability: 0.99
- Orbital coupling strength: 0.90
- Energy conservation: 0.99

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. Initialize the photon with phase \(\theta_{\gamma} \in [0,1)\) and advancement rate \(\Delta \theta_{\gamma} = 0.05\).
2. Construct the node list as above; this corresponds to `PhotonTimingPattern()` in `etm/particles.py`.
3. Use `set_photon_energy(energy_ev)` to configure frequency and wavelength according to the desired energy content.
4. During simulation, update phase each tick and propagate node positions according to the core engine’s 8‑connectivity rules.
5. Track interaction strength with electron patterns via `calculate_orbital_interaction_strength` and handle absorption or emission events when thresholds are met.

**Physical Interpretation**:
The photon-type traveling pattern represents a quantized electromagnetic wave packet traversing the ETM lattice. Its structured propagation front ensures consistent speed and interaction capability, allowing it to transfer energy to or from charged leptons without loss of coherence.

**Validation Status**: ✅ **Validated** — photon propagation tests confirm stable travel over 100 ticks with energy conservation within 1% and successful orbital coupling events above the 0.3 absorption threshold.
