# ETM Simulation Research Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step strategy for determining the ETM equivalents of several well-known physical constants. The approach focuses on building successive simulations that reveal how space and time emerge from node interactions and timing coordination.
### Fundamental ETM Dynamics Rule
All motion, propagation, and effects MUST take place only according to ETM logic, including the propagation of light. It is ok to start an identity like an electron with an initial velocity, but after the start, it must proceed disappearing from some nodes and returning in other nodes purely and exclusively from ETM logic, NOT from some arbitrarily defined velocity function, and the same goes for the propagation of light. In fact, every single change in the simulation must only occur due to ETM logic after the start. This must be a standing rule in all testing.


### Development Phases
- **Phase 1 – Codex Validation**: Implement all stages using lattices up to about 30×30×30 to ensure functionality in this chat environment.
- **Phase 2 – Home Computer Scale-Up**: Once code is stable, run larger lattices (50³ or greater) on your personal machine for extended simulations.

## Overview of Constants
We aim to establish ETM analogues for the following:

- Speed of light in vacuum
- Planck constant and reduced Planck constant
- Planck time and Planck length
- Coulomb constant
- Vacuum permeability and permittivity
- Fine structure constant

These values should be derived solely from ETM logic. Calibration between ETM units and SI units will rely on the speed of light in vacuum and energy levels in the hydrogen atom.

## Simulation Stages

### 1. Photon Propagation
Simulate photon propagation across empty lattice regions and within various timing gradients. Measure the resulting travel times and deflection angles.
- **Goal**: Quantify how node spacing, tick rate, and environmental interactions influence the effective speed of light.
- **Node Count**: Start with lattices of ~10^4 nodes for simple propagation tests and scale up to ~10^6 nodes to examine subtle timing gradients.
- **Validation**: Trial 004 (to be revised with ETM-driven motion) confirmed one-step-per-tick propagation across a (21,21,21) lattice, establishing the baseline ETM speed of light.
- **Validation**: Trial 005 demonstrated photon deflection in a lattice with a linear echo-field gradient, confirming that environmental timing variations steer propagation purely through ETM logic.
- **Validation**: Trial 006 measured electron--photon coupling using orbital interaction metrics, showing hydrogen photons satisfy the absorption criteria.
- **Validation**: Trial 007 verified that the same metrics allow electrons to emit hydrogen photons, establishing bidirectional photon exchange rules.
- **Validation**: Trial 008 quantified energy transfer during hydrogen-photon absorption, verifying the electron's energy increase matches the 13.6 eV photon.

### 2. Electron Orbitals and Photon Exchange
Model a hydrogen atom where electrons transition between timing patterns while emitting or absorbing photons.
- **Goal**: Determine how energy differences in orbital transitions correspond to ETM's analogue of the Planck constant.
- **Node Count**: Use lattices ranging from 10^6 to 10^7 nodes to capture orbital structure and photon exchange accurately.

### 3. Long-Range Electric Interaction
Place an electron and positron at rest in a large lattice so that they interact solely through timing disturbances.
- **Goal**: Measure the attractive force as a function of node separation to define an ETM analogue of the Coulomb constant.
- **Node Count**: Lattice sizes of at least 10^7 nodes are recommended to minimize boundary effects.
- **Validation**: Trial 009 demonstrated qualitative attraction between an electron and a positron on a 21×21×21 lattice using echo gradients, verifying that long-range timing disturbances steer motion without preset velocities.
- **Validation**: Trial 010 measured convergence times for different initial separations, providing baseline data for estimating the ETM Coulomb constant.

### 4. Magnetic Interaction
Introduce moving charges and analyze the timing disturbances produced by their motion.
- **Goal**: Derive the magnetic component of the electromagnetic force, leading to an ETM form of vacuum permeability.
- **Node Count**: Similar to the electric force simulation, target around 10^7 nodes.

### 5. Fine Structure Constant
Combine the results from electric and magnetic simulations with orbital transition data.
- **Goal**: Establish a dimensionless ratio comparable to the fine structure constant.
- **Node Count**: Use ~10^7 nodes to match precision from prior stages.

### 6. Planck Scale Analogues
Analyze the minimal timing and spacing intervals that arise naturally from ETM node rules.
- **Goal**: Map these intervals to Planck time and Planck length equivalents after calibrating other constants.
- **Node Count**: Resolution at this scale may require extremely dense lattices—explore ~10^8 nodes if resources allow.

## Practical Considerations
- **Hardware Requirements**: Large-scale simulations (10^7–10^8 nodes) may exceed typical notebook capacity. Running them on a dedicated desktop with at least 32&nbsp;GB of RAM is advisable.
- **Codex Environment**: Use lattices up to about 30×30×30 (~27,000 nodes) to guarantee smooth execution. All stages of this plan will first be implemented and validated at this scale before running larger simulations.
- **Running on a Home Computer**: Create a lightweight script that loads the ETM engine with the desired lattice size and runs in the background. Use Python's multiprocessing to maintain responsiveness while the simulation progresses for several hours.
- **Data Storage**: Direct results to log files or compressed binary formats to reduce disk usage.
- **Adjustable Plan**: Begin with smaller lattices to validate the approach, then scale up gradually. Calibrate ETM units to SI using photon propagation in vacuum and hydrogen spectral lines, and refine constants as simulation size increases.

## Expected Precision
Achieving four significant digits should be feasible with 10^7–10^8 nodes if simulations run long enough to average out fluctuations. The key is consistent calibration using the same photon and hydrogen benchmarks across experiments.
