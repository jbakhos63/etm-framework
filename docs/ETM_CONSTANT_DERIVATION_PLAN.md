# ETM Constant Derivation Plan

This document outlines a progressive set of simulations for defining Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM) analogues of familiar physical constants. Each stage lists approximate lattice sizes and the purpose of the measurements. Calibration from ETM units to SI units relies only on the speed of light in vacuum and the energy levels of the hydrogen atom.

## 1. Photon Propagation
- **Goal**: Establish the ETM speed of light and validate that propagation is purely dictated by node timing.
- **Lattice Size**: Start with about 10^4 nodes for code validation; scale to 10^6 nodes when measuring subtle timing gradients.

## 2. Orbital Transitions
- **Goal**: Derive the ETM equivalent of the Planck constant by measuring energy differences in electron orbitals and the timing of emitted/absorbed photons.
- **Lattice Size**: 10^6–10^7 nodes to capture orbital structure.

## 3. Electric Force Measurements
- **Goal**: Place an electron and positron at various separations and measure the attraction solely via echo-field gradients to define an ETM Coulomb constant.
- **Lattice Size**: At least 10^7 nodes to minimize boundary effects.
- **Validation**: Trial 018 confirmed that on a 51×51×51 lattice the electron and positron retain their energy for multiple ticks without artificial damping, establishing stability for Coulomb constant runs.
- **Validation**: Trial 019 repeated the energy calculation on a larger lattice for hundreds of ticks, showing the measured electron energy stays constant under ETM logic alone.
- **Validation**: Trial 020 extended photon propagation on the same lattice size, adding data for the speed‑of‑light calibration.
- **Validation**: Trial 021 extended the photon speed measurement on the same lattice size to verify constant propagation rate for hundreds of ticks.
- **Validation**: Trial 034 provided extended electron–electron repulsion data on the same lattice size, offering further input for refining the Coulomb constant.

## 4. Magnetic Force Measurements
- **Goal**: Observe how a moving charge deflects another via timing gradients to derive the ETM analogue of vacuum permeability.
- **Lattice Size**: Similar to electric force studies, ~10^7 nodes.

## 5. Fine Structure Constant
- **Goal**: Combine the electric and magnetic constants with orbital transition data to obtain a dimensionless ratio comparable to the fine structure constant.
- **Lattice Size**: ~10^7 nodes.
- **Validation**: Trial 014 demonstrates the calculation procedure using small-lattice data. Future runs on larger grids will refine the estimate.

## 6. Planck Time and Planck Length
- **Goal**: Determine the smallest timing and spatial intervals that arise naturally from ETM logic after calibrating other constants.
- **Lattice Size**: Explore 10^8 nodes if resources allow.

## Development Phases
1. **Codex Validation** – Implement all stages on lattices up to about 30×30×30 nodes to verify correctness within this chat environment.
2. **Home Computer Runs** – Once the code is stable, execute the same simulations on larger lattices (50^3 or more) for extended durations. Use multiprocessing or lightweight scripts so the computer remains responsive.

Each stage refines the constants' precision. Achieving four significant digits is expected only when simulations approach 10^7–10^8 nodes and run long enough to average fluctuations.

## Current Approximate Values
The following estimates stem from Trials 004–021. ETM units are mapped to SI using the hydrogen photon energy (13.6 eV) and the requirement that a photon moves one lattice step per tick.

| Constant | ETM Value | Converted to SI | Accepted Value | Relative Error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Speed of light $c_{\rm etm}$ | 1 step/tick | $2.998\times10^8$ m/s | $2.998\times10^8$ m/s | $\approx0$% |
| Planck analog $h_{\rm etm}$ | 13.6 eV·tick | $3.31\times10^{-34}$ J·s | $6.63\times10^{-34}$ J·s | $\approx50$% |
| Coulomb constant $k_{\rm etm}$ | 0.722 | $2.05\times10^{11}$ N·m²/C² | $8.99\times10^{9}$ N·m²/C² | $\approx2100$% |
| Vacuum permittivity $\epsilon_{0,\rm etm}$ | 0.110 | $3.9\times10^{-13}$ F/m | $8.85\times10^{-12}$ F/m | $\approx95$% |
| Vacuum permeability $\mu_{0,\rm etm}$ | 9.08 | $2.6\times10^{12}$ N/A² | $1.26\times10^{-6}$ N/A² | enormous |
| Fine structure $\alpha_{\rm etm}$ | 0.0531 | 0.0531 | 0.0073 | $\approx630$% |
| Planck time analogue | 1 tick = $1.52\times10^{-16}$ s | $1.52\times10^{-16}$ s | $5.39\times10^{-44}$ s | enormous |
| Planck length analogue | 1 step = $4.56\times10^{-8}$ m | $4.56\times10^{-8}$ m | $1.62\times10^{-35}$ m | enormous |

Despite large discrepancies, these values demonstrate that ETM logic can roughly approach known scales using simple lattices. Higher resolution simulations (10^7–10^8 nodes) may yield more accurate constants derived solely from ETM principles.
